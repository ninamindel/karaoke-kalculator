Next, we calculated the noise that comes from dissimilarity and found how many coeffiecients are greater than x (we used .4)
Then, we divided that number by some number (we choose 6000) to find vocal quality and then subtract that from one to find the percentage similar.
It is important to note that some amount of noise comes from how we recorded it, but most of it is truly from dissimilarity
